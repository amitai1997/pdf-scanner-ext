Your Assignment
Implement an application that will capture PDF file uploads to ChatGPT in chrome 
(or another web AI site that accepts file uploads), send the files to a file inspection 
service and log the results.
The file inspection service should inspect and identify PDF files that contain 
secrets:
 In case it detected a secret, it is enough to alert the user with a pop-up without
blocking it.
 Your file inspection service should use Prompt Security text inspection API for 
the identification of the secrets in text.
An example of using the text inspection API using curl:
curl --location 'https://eu.prompt.security/api/protect' \
--header 'APPID cc6a6cfc-95704e5a-b6ea-92d2adac90e4' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"prompt": "TEXT TO INSPECT"}'
