How Claude talks to your sources.
	1.	Servers: filesystem, git, firecrawl, notionâ€”least scopes only.
	2.	Use open / click / find verbs to fetch content; cite returned IDs.
	3.	Prefer internal docs before Firecrawl; never paste secrets in prompts.
	4.	Re-index weekly; refresh tokens on 401s.
	5.	Log key Claude insights back to Notion.
