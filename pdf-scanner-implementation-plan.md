# PDF Security Scanner — Strategic Plan

## 1. Project Overview

A Chrome extension that detects sensitive information in PDF files before they reach AI services like ChatGPT and Claude, with a lightweight backend service for scanning and verification.

## 2. Architecture

- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest V3-based extension that intercepts PDF uploads across multiple AI platforms
- **Inspection Service**: Node.js/Express backend for PDF text extraction and secret detection
- **External API**: Integration with Prompt Security API for ML-based secret detection
- **Communication**: HTTPS REST APIs for all component communication

## 3. Current Status

- **Extension**: Core functionality working for ChatGPT, including:
  - Multiple detection methods (file inputs, XHR/fetch monitoring)
  - Immediate user feedback with UI indicators
  - Security warning modals for detected secrets
  - Basic settings and tracking capabilities

- **Backend Service**: Functional with:
  - PDF text extraction with robust fallback mechanisms
  - Prompt Security API integration
  - Basic error handling and request validation
  - Local scanning capabilities for offline/fallback use

## 4. Priorities for Completion

### Multi-site Support
- Expand to work reliably with multiple AI platforms:
  - Claude.ai (Anthropic)
  - Gemini (Google AI)
  - Support for platform-specific file upload mechanisms

### Production Containerization
- Dockerize the inspection service
  - Create secure, production-ready container configuration
  - Implement proper health checks and graceful shutdowns
  - Support environment-based configuration
  - Optimize for cloud deployment environments

### Deployment Documentation
- Create comprehensive guides for:
  - Local development environment setup
  - Production deployment options and best practices
  - Security considerations and recommendations
  - Scaling and monitoring approaches

## 5. Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] **Security**:
  - Secure API key handling
  - HTTPS-only communication
  - CSP hardening for extension
  - Input validation and sanitization

- [ ] **Reliability**:
  - Error recovery mechanisms
  - Graceful degradation
  - Retry strategies for API failures
  - Automatic version checks

- [ ] **Performance**:
  - PDF processing optimizations
  - Caching strategies
  - Request throttling and batching
  - Efficient resource usage

- [ ] **Observability**:
  - Structured logging
  - Error reporting
  - Basic telemetry
  - Monitoring hooks

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Blocking Mode**: Option to prevent uploads containing secrets
- **Scan History**: User-accessible history of scanned files
- **Custom Rules**: User-defined patterns and sensitivity levels
- **Advanced Reporting**: Detailed scanning analytics
- **Team Policies**: Organization-wide settings and rules

## 7. Deployment Targets

- **Extension**: Chrome Web Store (and potentially Firefox Add-ons)
- **Backend**: Containerized service deployable to any cloud provider:
  - AWS ECS/Fargate
  - Google Cloud Run
  - Azure Container Apps
  - Self-hosted Kubernetes

## 8. Timeline

- **Days 1-3**: ✅ Core functionality implemented
- **Day 4**: Multi-site support and containerization
- **Day 5**: Documentation, packaging, and final testing
