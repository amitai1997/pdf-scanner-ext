# PDF Scanner Icons

These are placeholder icon files for the PDF Scanner extension.

For Day 1, we're using simple placeholders. In production, these should be:
- 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 pixel PNG files
- Professional design with PDF/security theme
- Proper transparency and contrast

To generate proper icons, you can:
1. Design in Figma/Sketch with the shield+PDF concept
2. Use an icon generator like app-icon.co
3. Export all required sizes

Current placeholder files:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon32.png (32x32) 
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)
