# Icon Placeholder Generator for Day 1

For Day 1, we need basic icon files. Here's how to create them:

## Option 1: Use online icon generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple design with:
   - Background: #4CAF50 (green)
   - Text: "PDF" or shield symbol
   - Export as PNG in multiple sizes

## Option 2: Use system tools (macOS)
```bash
# Create a simple colored square
echo "Creating placeholder icons..."
# This would require ImageMagick or similar tools
```

## Option 3: Copy from existing extension
For now, you can temporarily copy icon files from any other Chrome extension
in your system, just to get the extension loading.

## Temporary Workaround
The extension will load with missing icons, but Chrome will show warnings.
This is acceptable for Day 1 development and testing.

## Required sizes
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

All should be PNG format with transparent background.
